# fstore-mode

`fstore-mode` is an Emacs major mode for editing `.fstore` files (See
[this project](https://github.com/ranjeethmahankali/fstore) to
understand what `.fstore` files are). It provides the following
features:

- Basic syntax highlighting.
- Autocompletion for filepaths and tags.
- Command to preview the file at point: `fstore-preview-file`.
- Minor mode to always preview the file at point as you move around
  the buffer: `fstore-follow-mode`.
- Command to quickly track all untracked files in the directory:
  `fstore-track-untracked-files`.
